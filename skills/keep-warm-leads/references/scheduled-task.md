# Scheduled task: Warm follow-ups

Create nothing until the user has answered part 1.

The task writes with the user's outreach skill, named "(company)-politereach-skill". Find it among their skills first. If theirs has another name, ask which one it is and use that name. If they have none, offer to build it first (the `outreach-skill-builder` skill, or `li_setup_guide` step `outreach_skill`) and stop. Its `references/stage-templates.md` holds the default chain per stage; if it has none, the task proposes chains without a template.

Also needed: the PoliteReach tools (`li_*`), and the app's scheduled-tasks feature (claude.ai and Cowork: Scheduled; Claude Code: `/schedule`; ChatGPT: tasks). Without scheduling, offer to run the TASK PROMPT below once, by hand, in this conversation.

## Part 1: ask first

If this app has a tool for asking a question with options to pick, ask each question with it (the default first; the user can always type their own answer). Otherwise ask in one message, numbered, defaults in brackets, so the user can answer "defaults". If their outreach skill already answers one, say what you took from it. Ask their timezone if unknown.

1. Which PoliteReach accounts should it cover? Use the names from `li_list_accounts`. [all of them]
2. Send or draft? Send: it sends the due LinkedIn steps of chains you already approved, including steps you saved as draft, word for word, when nothing new happened in the thread; everything it writes itself comes to you as a draft. Draft: it sends nothing and shows you every due touch. [draft]
3. Which email do your email follow-ups go out from? Only that connector is used, to put email steps in your drafts and to notice which ones you sent. [none: email steps come to you as text]
4. Which calendar do your bookings land on (the one in your outreach skill)? It is used to check nobody is chased after booking a call. [the connected one; none = anyone with your booking link is drafted for you, never sent]
5. When should it run, in your timezone? [every day at 09:30]

## Part 2: create the task

Create a recurring scheduled task named "Warm follow-ups" at the chosen time, in the user's timezone, with the TASK PROMPT below: CONFIG filled in, the rest word for word. Attach the user's (company)-politereach-skill to the task and put its exact name in CONFIG, so every run loads it.

Tell the user the task name and next run, and remind them to set every tool it uses to always allow, the email and calendar tools included: nobody is there to approve a tool while it runs. Choosing send mode here is the user's standing approval to send the chain steps they already approved. Offer one run now so they can watch it.

## TASK PROMPT

```text
Work my warm LinkedIn leads via PoliteReach: whoever's next touch is due today. Nobody is watching this run: never ask a question, decide and act within MODE.

CONFIG
- Skill: (my company)-politereach-skill
- Accounts: (my account names)
- MODE: (draft | send). In draft mode never call li_send_message or li_send_reply: put each message you would have sent under DRAFTS in the report.
- Email connector: (Gmail | Outlook | other | none)
- Calendar connector: (Google Calendar | Microsoft 365 / Outlook | Calendly | Cal.com | none)

SETUP
1. Load my outreach skill (named in CONFIG) and follow its voice and rules for every word. If it cannot be loaded, notify me "(task name) failed: skill not found" and stop. Read its references/stage-templates.md if it has one.
2. Make sure the PoliteReach tools (li_*) are loaded (if this app defers tools, search for them first). If they are missing, notify me "(task name) failed: PoliteReach not connected" and stop.
3. li_list_accounts. Use the CONFIG accounts; if a name no longer matches, pick the closest. Skip and report any account that is paused or needs signing in again (fix: Reconnect on the PoliteReach Accounts page).
4. Load the CONFIG email and calendar connectors' tools, if any. One that is missing is not a stop: email steps then come to me as text, and anyone with my booking link is drafted, never sent. Say which one was missing in the report.

FIND WHAT IS DUE
5. li_warm_due with includeThread true and limit 100, once per CONFIG account (sessionLabel). There is no paging: if truncated or scanTruncated is true, work the rows you got and say in the report "list incomplete: N more due, not shown" (N = total minus rows); never call the list complete. If the read is unreadable or fails, notify me "(task name) failed: warm list unreadable" and stop; never report "nothing due" from a failed read.
6. Rows come most overdue first. If a row's thread is empty or does not show the last messages, read li_conversation_history for that person (never a live read per person).

WORK EACH ROW BY ITS REASONS
A. chain_step_due with a draftedStep:
   - Read the thread first. Anything new from them since the chain started: send nothing, list under NEEDS CHECK (the chain should have stopped).
   - My booking link is in the thread, or a call was agreed or booked: search my calendar for them first (full name, then first name + company). Booked: send nothing, li_mark_booked with the event id and start, list under BOOKED. No calendar connector: draft only.
   - draftedStep.sendsItself true: PoliteReach sends this step itself in sending hours. Never call li_send_message for it: list it under LATER TODAY, send nothing.
   - Other LinkedIn step (a draft step): in send mode, li_send_message with draftedStep.text word for word, the row's account as sessionLabel, confirmSend true, once. Only when the text still fits the thread; if it no longer does, rewrite it and put both under DRAFTS instead of sending. In draft mode, list it under DRAFTS.
   - Email step: never send email. If the email connector can make drafts, create one to the row's email with the step text and a short subject, and list it under EMAIL DRAFTS. No connector or no address: list the text under EMAIL DRAFTS.
B. Email steps I already sent: if the email connector can search sent mail, look for a message to the row's email since the step's dueAt. Found: li_log_touch with channel email, direction out, at = its sent time, note "chain step sent". The step then completes by itself.
C. they_wrote_last: never send. Write a suggested answer in my voice under OWED, naming the channel they wrote on. A LinkedIn reply is also handled by my replies routine: say so instead of drafting twice if one exists.
D. next_step_date: the stage's nextStep is due. Draft the touch that does it under DUE, with the stage note, owner and date. If the next step is not a message (send a proposal, set up an account), list it as a task for me.
E. quiet: a live stage, no chain, no touch either way for 7 days. Write the chain from the stage's template in my skill (steps, delays, channel, mode, every word written for this person) under PROPOSED CHAINS. Never create a chain in this run: I approve each one in chat, then it is created with li_create_followup_chain and confirmChain true.
F. Every row: unreadStreak 2 or more means no read receipt on our last LinkedIn messages (receipts can be off, so never call it unread). suggestedChannel email: make the next touch an email draft. emailMissing true: write "email (no address stored)" next to the person.

DUPLICATES: a send refused because the identical message went or was queued minutes ago already went. Check li_conversation_history or li_job_result, list it under NEEDS CHECK, and never resend; never use force. A refusal that says the duplicate check could not be made was NOT sent: try it once more after a minute, never with force.

MESSAGE RULES (hard)
Max 3 short sentences, one idea per line, blank line between lines. No em dashes, no exclamation marks, no emojis. No filler: no "just checking in", "circling back", "bumping this". Each touch brings one new reason or one clear ask. Never repeat what the thread already covered. Never invent a price, client, metric or date. A name in all capitals or all lowercase gets normal capitals ("SOHAN" → "Sohan"); a mixed-case name ("McDonald", "deVries") stays exactly as written.

If any tool returns a security-check or sign-in error, stop work on that account and report it; never retry around it.

REPORT: OWED first, then DUE, then SENT (or DRAFTS), EMAIL DRAFTS, BOOKED, PROPOSED CHAINS, LATER TODAY, NEEDS CHECK. Each message in a code block, each person with their stage and the account. Then one line "Warm: N due, N sent, N drafted, N chains proposed".
Notify me once only when something was sent, drafted, proposed or needs me: first line the counts, then one short line per person who wrote last. Notify too if the run could not work (connector failing, every account blocked).
EMPTY RUN = SILENCE: nothing due means no notification and no message. End with exactly "Nothing due."
```
